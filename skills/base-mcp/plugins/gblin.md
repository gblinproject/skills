# GBLIN Protocol Plugin

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## STOP — COMPLETE ONBOARDING BEFORE USING THIS PLUGIN
>
> Before calling any GBLIN endpoint, you MUST complete the Base MCP onboarding flow:
> 1. Call `get_wallets` (Detection) — the user's wallet address is required by every prepare call
> 2. Present wallet status and disclaimer (Onboarding)
>
> Do NOT calculate amounts, fetch NAV, or prepare any transaction before the wallet address is confirmed.

GBLIN (Global Balanced Liquidity Index) is a treasury-backed index token on Base mainnet. Every GBLIN is backed by real on-chain collateral (WETH + cbBTC + USDC), priced in real time via Chainlink oracles. NAV = treasury value / circulating supply. There is no pre-mint: supply starts at zero.

Fetch unsigned calldata from the GBLIN x402 API, then execute via Base MCP's `send_calls`.

**Contract (Base mainnet):** `0xc2181d975c05c8c724b334bcED0764c0b86B1D53`
**Supported chain:** Base mainnet (`8453` / `0x2105`)
**API base:** `https://gblin.digital`

**x402 paywall:** endpoints under `/api/x402/*` require a micro-payment via EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` before the response is served. This API speaks x402 v2; recommended client is `@x402/fetch` or `@x402/axios`. When Base MCP's `web_request` tool calls a paywalled endpoint it receives HTTP 402 with the payment challenge (also mirrored in the response body). Complete the x402 payment flow before retrying.

**Free, no payment required:** `/api/x402/llms.txt` (discovery), `/api/x402/attestation-sample` (schema sample of a risk attestation), and the whole MCP surface below.

**Free MCP (no install):** `https://gblin-mcp.gblin-mcp-worker.workers.dev/mcp` (Streamable HTTP) exposes the live market risk regime, an attestation sample, protocol info and the daily coherence report. The stdio server is `npx @gblin-protocol/mcp-server`. Use these when you only need to read state — pay only for the wallet-specific and calldata endpoints.

**Fetching calldata:** the GBLIN API is not on the Base MCP `web_request` allowlist. Construct every prepare URL as a GET request with all parameters in the query string. If `web_request` rejects the host, fetch through whatever capability the harness exposes (shell, direct HTTP, MCP server), or ask the user to paste the JSON response into the chat. Then continue with `send_calls`.

## Protocol discovery (free, no paywall)

```
GET https://gblin.digital/api/x402/llms.txt
```

Returns a human-readable summary of the protocol and the available endpoints with their prices. Use this first to confirm the protocol is reachable before attempting paywalled calls.

---

## Read endpoints (x402 paywalled)

### Treasury state & NAV — $0.001 USDC

```
GET https://gblin.digital/api/x402/treasury-state
```

Returns NAV in USD, basket composition with dynamic weights, and Crash Shield status.

**Use this to:** confirm NAV before quoting, check whether the Crash Shield is active, verify treasury health.

### Health check (wallet-specific) — $0.002 USDC

```
GET https://gblin.digital/api/x402/health?wallet=<wallet_address>&daily_burn=<usd_per_day>
```

`daily_burn` is optional; when provided, the response adds an operational runway estimate and a rebalance recommendation.

Response shape:

```json
{
  "wallet": "0x...",
  "balances": { "gblin": "…", "gblin_value_usd": 0, "usdc": "…", "eth": "…", "total_usd": 0 },
  "ratios": { "gblin_pct": 0, "usdc_pct": 0 },
  "gas_health": { "status": "ok|low|critical", "eth_balance": "…", "warning": null },
  "cooldown": { "active": false, "seconds_remaining": 0, "last_deposit_unix": 0 },
  "recommendation": "…"
}
```

**Use this to:** verify the user has enough USDC before investing, check the redemption cooldown after a mint (20 seconds, a vault parameter), confirm current holdings and gas runway.

### Quote — $0.001 USDC

```
GET https://gblin.digital/api/x402/quote?direction=buy&amount=<eth_decimal>
GET https://gblin.digital/api/x402/quote?direction=sell&amount=<gblin_decimal>
```

For `direction=buy`, `amount` is in ETH (the vault sets no minimum). For `direction=sell`, `amount` is in GBLIN. Returns the expected output, a safe `minOut` including a dynamic slippage buffer, and the mint fee breakdown (10 bps).

### Governance check — $0.001 USDC

```
GET https://gblin.digital/api/x402/governance
```

Verifies on-chain that the contract owner is the 48-hour Timelock and reads its minimum delay. Use it when a user asks who can change protocol parameters.

### Risk attestation — $0.003 USDC

```
GET https://gblin.digital/api/x402/attestation
```

A perishable (10-minute) proof of the current BTC/ETH risk regime (`calm` | `elevated` | `crash`), derived from the on-chain Crash Shield. Attach it to your own action as portable proof-of-diligence. A free sample of the exact schema is at `/api/x402/attestation-sample`, and the live regime is readable for free through the MCP endpoint above.

---

## Prepare endpoints (x402 paywalled)

> All prepare endpoints return **unsigned calldata only**. No transaction is ever executed server-side. The user must sign and broadcast via `send_calls`.

### Invest USDC → GBLIN — $0.002 USDC

```
GET https://gblin.digital/api/x402/invest?usdc=<decimal>&wallet=<wallet_address>
```

Returns a 2-step ordered batch of unsigned calldata. The vault never swaps, so an arbitrary token goes through the Zap: approve USDC to the Zap, then one call that swaps USDC→WETH on the adapter and mints at NAV. Every step carries a non-zero `minOut`.

Response shape:

```json
{
  "action": "sequential_txs",
  "steps": [
    { "step": 1, "description": "Approve USDC to the GBLIN Zap", "target": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913", "calldata": "0x...", "value": "0" },
    { "step": 2, "description": "Swap USDC to WETH and mint GBLIN at NAV, in one transaction", "target": "0x0E9D6Ceb6D313b021622C121Cda9C62e86e60200", "calldata": "0x...", "value": "0" }
  ],
  "expected": { "usdc_in": "…", "weth_min": "…", "gblin_expected": "…", "gblin_min": "…", "slippage_buffer_pct": 0, "slippage_reason": "…" },
  "security": { "mev_protected": true, "min_outs_set": true }
}
```

### JIT redeem GBLIN → USDC — $0.005 USDC

```
GET https://gblin.digital/api/x402/jit?usdc=<decimal>&wallet=<wallet_address>
```

Just-In-Time redemption to pay an x402 invoice when USDC runs short. Redemption is **three steps** (approve the shares to the Zap, `GBLINZap.sellGBLINForEth` — redeem in kind and sell every leg, all or nothing — then a Uniswap WETH→USDC swap) returned in the same `sequential_txs` shape as invest. An EOA signs three times; an ERC-4337 / EIP-7702 account can batch them into one operation. Requires the redemption cooldown (20 seconds after a mint for oneself) to have elapsed. Give step 2 a gas limit of at least `gas_hint`: the Zap forwards gas-capped transfers, so a tight limit reverts.

```json
{
  "action": "sequential_txs",
  "steps": [ { "step": 1, "target": "0x...", "calldata": "0x...", "value": "0" }, { "step": 2, "…": "…" }, { "step": 3, "…": "…" } ],
  "params": { "gblin_amount": "…", "eth_min_out": "…", "target_token": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913", "min_usdc_out": "…" },
  "expected": { "usdc_out": "…", "nav_used_usd": 0, "slippage_buffer_pct": 0 },
  "compatibility": { "eoa": true, "erc4337": true, "eip7702": true },
  "gas_hint": 1100000
}
```

## send_calls mapping

> **Field mapping:** GBLIN uses `target`/`calldata` instead of the Base MCP standard `to`/`data`. Map them explicitly before calling `send_calls`. Both invest and JIT return the same `steps[]` array, so one mapping covers both.

```json
{
  "chain": "base",
  "calls": [
    { "to": "<steps[0].target>", "value": "<steps[0].value as hex>", "data": "<steps[0].calldata>" },
    { "to": "<steps[1].target>", "value": "<steps[1].value as hex>", "data": "<steps[1].calldata>" }
  ]
}
```

Include one entry per element of `steps[]`, in the order returned — 2 for invest, 3 for JIT. Never reorder them, and carry each step's `value` over as hex: the JIT swap step sends ETH.

---

## Orchestration patterns

### Pattern A — Invest idle USDC into GBLIN

```
1. get_wallets → address
2. GET /api/x402/health?wallet=<address>  [pay $0.002 x402]
   → verify usdc balance >= requested amount
   → verify cooldown.active = false
3. GET /api/x402/quote?direction=buy&amount=<eth>  [pay $0.001 x402]
   → show user: expected_gblin_out, safe_min_gblin_out, fees
   → ask for confirmation before proceeding
4. GET /api/x402/invest?usdc=<amount>&wallet=<address>  [pay $0.002 x402]
   (if web_request rejects host, fetch directly or ask user to paste JSON)
5. Map steps[] → calls[] (target→to, calldata→data, value→hex)
6. send_calls(chain="base", calls from steps[0..1])
7. User approves once → get_request_status(requestId)
8. Confirm both steps executed
```

**Preconditions to validate before step 4:**
- USDC balance ≥ requested amount + gas buffer
- Crash Shield status known (check treasury-state)
- Cooldown not active

### Pattern B — JIT redeem for an x402 payment

```
1. get_wallets → address
2. GET /api/x402/health?wallet=<address>  [pay $0.002 x402]
   → verify gblin balance >= required amount
   → verify cooldown.active = false (20-second lock after a mint for oneself)
3. GET /api/x402/jit?usdc=<amount>&wallet=<address>  [pay $0.005 x402]
4. Map steps[] → calls[] (3 calls)
5. send_calls(chain="base", calls=[step 1, step 2, step 3])
6. User approves → get_request_status(requestId)
```

### Pattern C — Portfolio check

```
1. get_wallets → address
2. GET /api/x402/treasury-state  [pay $0.001 x402]
   → NAV, basket composition, Crash Shield status
3. GET /api/x402/health?wallet=<address>  [pay $0.002 x402]
   → GBLIN balance in USD, USDC balance, gas health, cooldown
4. Present: current holdings value, treasury backing, basket breakdown
```

### Pattern D — Risk gate before deploying capital

```
1. Read the live risk regime for free from the MCP endpoint
   (tool: risk.regime)
2. If regime = "crash" → stand down: do not invest, tell the user why
3. Otherwise continue with Pattern A
4. If the user needs portable proof of the check, buy /api/x402/attestation
```

## Safety rules for agents

- **Never skip the quote step.** Always show NAV, expected output, and fees before executing invest.
- **Crash Shield:** if the treasury state reports the shield active, warn the user that basket weights have been defensively adjusted after a market drawdown beyond the protocol's crash threshold (15% base, adaptive with volatility). Do not block the transaction — the contract handles it — but explain the situation.
- **Cooldown:** if `cooldown.active` is true, do not attempt any sell or JIT redeem. Wait until `seconds_remaining` reaches zero (20 seconds after a mint for oneself).
- **Governance delay:** any protocol parameter change requires 48 hours via Timelock `0x6aBeC8716fFeEcf7C3D6e68255b4797113E8e5Dd`. Do not promise immediate changes, and do not describe the token as immutable.
- **GBLIN is not a stablecoin.** NAV moves with WETH and cbBTC prices. It is managed exposure for surplus capital, not a USDC substitute. Always present the current NAV before quoting.
- **Fees:** 10 bps on mint (5 protocol + 5 stability, which stays in the NAV) and a 0.50% a year management fee, accrued as new shares. Redemption pays no protocol fee.
- **x402 costs:** read operations cost $0.001–$0.003 USDC and prepare operations $0.002–$0.005 USDC. These are API charges, not gas.
